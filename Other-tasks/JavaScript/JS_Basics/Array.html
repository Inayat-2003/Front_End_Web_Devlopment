<!-- Complex data types: -->
<!-- Store multiple values: Complex data types can store multiple values or properties, 
unlike primitive types which store a single value.

-> Have structure: Complex data types have a structure or organization, 
such as key-value pairs in objects or indexed elements in arrays.

-> Can be manipulated: Complex data types can be manipulated and modified,
    such as adding or removing properties from an object or elements from an array. -->


<!-- 1. Array -->
<!-- An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. -->
<!-- In JavaScript, an array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, 
such as numbers, strings, or objects, in a single variable. 

-> Arrays are zero-indexed, 
meaning the first element at index is 0, and you can access elements using their index. -->


    <!-- syntax  -->
    <!-- let array = [primitive data]

    Square brackets []: Used to define the array.
    Elements: Separated by commas.
    Array name: Assign the array to a variable. -->




    <script>
        // 1.
        const array = ["Pietro", "Orange", "Aristotle", "Word", true, 32, 38439849384, 7.5,]
        console.log(array)
        // console.log(array.length)

        // value[index]
        // document.writeln(array [4])




        // 2. simple for loop 
        // This loop is useful when you need to access both 
        // the index and the value of each element in the array.)
        for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            // console.log(array[i]) 

            // document.write(i,"value => ",array[i],"<br>")  
        }




        // 3. For...of Loop
        // This loop is useful when you need to access the values of an array, 
        // without worrying about the index.


        for (let data of array) {
            // console.log(data)
            // document.write(data, "<br>")
        }

        //         When to use it:
        // When you need to perform an action on each element of an array or string.
        // When you don't need the index: When you only need to access the value of each element, not its index.





        // 4. for in index, values
        for (let index in array) {
            // console.log(index)
            // console.log(array[index])
            // document.write(index,"values =>",array[index],"<br>")
        }

        //     The reasons to avoid for...in with arrays are:
        // Index is a string in this: The index is returned as a string, not a number.

        // Iterates over all properties: for...in will iterate over all properties, 
        // including non-numeric ones, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

        // Order is not guaranteed: The order of iteration is not guaranteed to be the same 
        // as the order of the elements in the array.
