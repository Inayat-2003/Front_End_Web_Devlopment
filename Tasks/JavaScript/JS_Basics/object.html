<!-- In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs, 
where each key is a string (or symbol) and the value can be any data type, 
including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, functions, or even other objects. -->



<!-- Diffrence:
Objects are used to store key-value pairs with meaningful keys, 
allowing data access using keys for structured data with unique identifiers.

Arrays, on the other hand, store ordered collections of similar data, 
where elements are accessed using numeric indices, 
making them ideal for lists or collections of data. -->



<!-- syntax:-  -->
 <!-- let object = {
    key : "value"}
    index : value

Curly brackets {}: Used to define the object.
Key-value pairs: Each key is followed by a colon : and a value.
Keys: Typically strings, but can also be symbols.
Values: Can be any data type, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or other objects.
Comma separation: Key-value pairs are separated by commas.-->



    <script>
        // Creating an object
        let car = {
            brand: "Mercedes",
            model: "S-560",
            year: 2020
        };
        // document.write(car)

        // Access and print the car's brand and model
        //console.log("Brand:", car.brand);
        //console.log("Model:", car.model);
        // document.write(car.model)


        // to update any property
        //car.year = 2022;
        //console.log("Updated Year:", car.year);
        // document.write(car.year)

        // Add a new property color to the car object
        // car.color = "Blue";
        // console.log("Car Object:", car);
        // document.write(car.color)





        //     A traditional for loop won't work directly with objects because:
    // Objects are not indexed: Unlike arrays, objects don't have numeric indices, 
    // making it difficult to use a traditional for loop.

    // No length property: Objects don't have a built-in length property, 
    // which is typically used to determine the number of iterations in a for loop.

        for(let index in car){
            console.log(index)
            console.log(car[index])
            //document.writeln(index," => value => ",car[index],"<br>")
        }


    
    // Characteristics
    // Key-value pairs: Objects consist of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
    // Unordered: The order of key-value pairs is not guaranteed.
    // Mutable: Objects can be modified after creation.
